<h1>CoinSnatcherAI</h1>
This project presents a micro-game which is based on the idea of <b><em>Gamified Reinforcement Learning</em></b>. The Player has to compete against an <b>AI(RL) Agent</b> to collect <em>as many coins as possible</em> within a constrained amount of time. The project has been built with <b>Unity's <a href = "https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents">ml-agents</a></b> package.
